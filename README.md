# py_photo_slide
OpenAI based code to convert pictures of presentations taken from the audience into slides.

Scenario is your at a conference and take photos of the presentation but you want them cleaned up.  It seems this is still beyond AI's actual capability but it will provide code to do it - so this will be that code - perhaps with some required tweaks to carry out the task.  As per it's recommendation python and opencv are the main requirements.

Update - possibly works reasonably with white background slides - but really not great for dark slides at least at the quality of my pictures - so wouldn't hugely recommend using
